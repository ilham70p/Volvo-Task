# Volvo-Task
That was a task assigned by Volvo for internship.The main logic is developing a web app 
which will make easier for Volvo to control quality of produced bus parts. It has to allow for 
easy communication between users, testers, supervisors and factories. It should gather information 
from users and testers about quality of each part in each bus, store the data for statistics, and allow managers 
to access themÂ  in order to improve product quality

In this project I tried to show my skills about : Web Api,JWT, User role based  token authentication,Generic repository,
N tire deisgn pattern usage.
